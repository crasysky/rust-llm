# üéâ Welcome to **Rust-LLM** ‚Äì Gateway to Rust-Powered LLMs' Magic! üéâ  
Prepare to embark on a wild ride through the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Rust twist! ‚Äì We're blending the speed of Rust with the prowess of LLMs. üöÄ  

## üåü What‚Äôs This All About?  
**Rust-LLM** is an open-source library designed to make interacting with LLM APIs. It lets you chat with models like Deepseek, all while leveraging Rust's concurrency superpowers, featuring:
- **Async-first architecture** for concurrent AI conversations
- **Flexible API design** for custom conversation flows
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Custom client behavior** via trait implementations


## üé® What Can It Do?  
- **Talk to LLMs with Ease**: Use `DeepseekModel` to send messages and get responses. Check out `hello1.rs` for a quick taste!  
- **Concurrent Conversations**: Handle multiple chats at once with our concurrency magic in `concurrency.rs`. 
- **Custom Client Support**: Implement your own `ClientApi` (see `hello2.rs`) to tailor how your app chats with the world.  
- **Retry Logic Built-In**: No more crying over failed API calls ‚Äì the retry mechanism (powered by `config.rs`) keeps things rolling.  
- **Flexible Configuration**: Tweak models, tokens, and temperatures to your heart‚Äôs content via `api.rs` and `lib.rs`.  

## üöÄ Getting Started  
0. üîë API Key Configuration
   Use environment variables
   Create a `.env` file:
```bash
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env:

# For single runs:
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
cargo run --example hello1
```

1. Clone this repo like a boss:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crasysky/rust-llm.git
   cd rust-llm
   ```
2. Grab your dependencies with Cargo:  
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Pop your API key into `hello1.rs`, `hello2.rs`, `concurrency.rs` (replace that placeholder with your Deepseek key!).  
4. Run an example and watch the magic unfold:  
   ```bash
   cargo run --example hello1
   ```

## üìö Project Structure  
Peek under the hood:  
- `src/`: `api.rs`, `config.rs`, `error.rs`, and `lib.rs` power the engine.  
- `examples/`: Play with `hello1.rs`, `hello2.rs`, and `concurrency.rs` to see it in action.  
- `Cargo.toml`: The recipe for our Rust brew.

## üéÆ Fun Features  
- **Async All the Way**: Built with `tokio` for non-blocking, lightning-fast performance.  
- **Error Handling**: `error.rs` keeps things sane with recoverable and unrecoverable errors.  
- **Conversation Tracking**: The `Conversation` struct in `lib.rs` logs your chats.  

## ü§ì Contribute or Just Gawk  
Found a bug? Got a flashy idea? Fork this repo, tweak it, and send us a pull request! 

## Disclaimer  
You‚Äôll need a Deepseek API key to run the examples. Snag one from their site and keep it safe.

Happy coding! ü¶Ä
